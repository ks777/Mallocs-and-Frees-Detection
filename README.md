# Time-to-Detect-those-pesky-Mallocs-and-Frees

## Summary
C application, utilizing malloc and free for dynamic allocation in detecting errors. Created as an assignment for a CS college course.

## Purpose
This assignment was my introduction to the malloc/alloc/realloc concept and theory of dynamic allocation. These topics were a major component during my college career, as they would keep coming up even after this CS course was accomplished. The project holds as a testiment to my knowledge on the given topics, as it showed the basic methods in dynamic allocation and the correct usage of free().

## Instructions
The program was run through an IDE. (I believe i used Eclipse for this program)
